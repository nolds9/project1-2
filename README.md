1.  As a user, I want to be able to click on each box and try to match
2.  As a user, the boxes should be able to return face down if I don't match
3.  As an user, I want to create a function that allows the user to see which boxes have been matched so they don't click on those same boxes
4.  As an user, I want to have the user know how many tries it took them to finish the game so they can try on less attempts next game.
5.  As a user, I want to know how many tries it took me.
