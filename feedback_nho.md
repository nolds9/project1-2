# Project Feedback

## Project Workflow

>Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

**Meets Expectations**. Nice job meeting an achievable scope for the first project. At only 6 commits, I would've liked to see your original sketches, ideas for how the game would look. As we move forward for larger projects, it would be nice to have more thoughts from your planning process, such as a Trello board, and relevant wireframes.

## Technical Requirements

>Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**Meets Expectations**. Congratulations, your project shows prolific use of the technologies and concepts we have covered so far! You clearly identified the problem and came up with a functional game in 65 lines of code, pretty sweet! I really like your creativity with the design, and overall layout!

## Code Quality

>Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**Meets Expectations**. Nice and clean! Html is clearly structured, CSS looks good, and JS works! Moving forward, I recommend looking for ways to make your code more modular and also would like to see you take advantage of libraries that make our lives easier as developers, such as jQuery.

## Problem Solving

>Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

**Meets Expectations** Nice work on this project! In general, I would like to see more evidence of your struggle through a problem, whether that be through more user stories, code comments, or more commits.
